# Hand-Gesture-Steering-Control
Controls Steering in video games (A and D steering)

steering.py is initial (simpler) attempt
steeringv2.py is newer attempt

Lil demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10EynEyboUM

Notes to me:

- Sacrificed Accuracy for Optimization (need work on that)
- Still needs optimization
- Steering Sensitivity also needs work
- Steering strength should be proportional to tilt angle (don't know how I'd do that)
- Add second hand for Throttle and Brakes
